# Virtual Art Gallery
This project is a mordernised way of approach to an age old traditional problem of displaying or showcasing artwork.

## PROJECT METHODOLOGY 
* To represent our 2D work on a 3D virtual art gallery we use 3D object and prefabs from unity to implement it.
* We figured out that by using our phones porocessing capabilites itself we could run the model remotely.
* We found out that we require a frame of reference for the image being tracked and the picture of it will be shown later.
* We also made our model change the images to showcase our gallery over some interval of times .
* WE established a virtual walkthrough using our model.
